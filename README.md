# XAT_SCORE_CALCULATOR
This is a web scrapping project which calculates scores based on candidates response sheet
XAT -Xavier's Aptitude Test, is a computer based entrance test to get admission into postgraduate courses in top colleges of the country
XAT sends candidates response key along with the answer key in html format
## Approach
### **Libraries  Used**
* Requests
* Beautiful Soup
### Code Logic
* Since the response sheets are html coded,therefore getting data through Web Scrapping becomes easy
* I used requests library to get data from web,then used the beautiful Soup library to get through the html content
* Then I preprocessed the data to take out required fields, then I compared chosen options with the answer key to get results
